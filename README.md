# MemoryGame
This is a Memory Game project, in which we have to click any 2 cards and if the two cards match they stay open. Once all cards are matched, a popup message appears and congratulates the user for winning the game. The popup gives a score from 1 to 3 based on how much time it took and how many moves it took to finish the game.
